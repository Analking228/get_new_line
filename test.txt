Fleet Footwork: It grants 20% bonus movement speed for 1 second and 3 - 60 (based on level)|
(+30% bonus AD) health. The main reason why Fleet Footwork is the best on|
Jhin is because the keystone itself provides mobility and a bit of sustain while|
also granting access to the precision tree. The other Keystones are just as good,|
but because they provide bad overall trees it leaves|
Fleet Footwork to be the best.|
